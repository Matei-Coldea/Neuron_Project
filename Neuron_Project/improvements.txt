- make the fucking boundary work !!!
- add metadata panel for the initial figure (changable) and a save button for the initial figure with the new metadata
- make it be able to open multiple figure and batches at once like a text editor with tabs and make memory check for that 
so it does not use too much memory 
- add maybe a settings panel where to save that 
- make everything faster
